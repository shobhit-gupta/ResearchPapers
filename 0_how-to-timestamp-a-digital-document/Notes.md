# Notes on [How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00196791) by Stuart Haber & W. Scott Stornetta

This is the legendary paper on the blockchain data structure. It introduces Blockchain data structure as a solution to the following problem: _How to certifying when a document is created or modified?_

## Problem

Essentially, the problem is of timestamping documents in a manner which is beyond any doubt. In other words, **the goal is to propose a Time-Stamping Service (TSS) which makes it infeasible for users to back-date or forward-date their documents even with the collusion of TSS.** Such a TSS would be of great value. For instance, in intellectual property disputes.

## Solutions for Non-Digital Documents

1. Diary Entries

       - Or reviewed & signed by a company manager.
   - In case of a dispute, the following can substantiate inventor's claims
     - Physical Evidence
       - Sequentially numbered, sewn-in pages makes it difficult to tamper certain things.
         - Such as adding or removing pages.
         - Though notes on a page maybe modified to an extent.
     - Established Procedure
       - Periodic Stamping increases confidence that other parties can vouch for inventor's claims.
2. Self-Mail
   - Procedure
     - Mail the document as a letter to oneself.
     - On receipt, leave it unopened.
   - In case of a dispute,
